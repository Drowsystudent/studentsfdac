I am Gabriel Carson. I am a Senior Computer Science major in my last semester of my Bachelor's Degree. I enjoy Cloud engineering and distributed 
systems and plan to incorporate that into my semester project in some way. I have experience in Data Platforms at ORNL where I spent a year working 
on the ETAC data platform.
